# ArcGIS - Los Angeles Poverty<br />
People living in poverty can be found in almost every part of American cities. As result, these socioeconomic disadvantages play a role in minimizing the average of achievement within the community. Poverty maps based on a series of poverty metrics, when properly built, offer a clear view of the location as well as the interconnected deprivations of the poorest, allowing interventions to be planned and targeted more efficiently. When we can get a good picture of poverty-stricken areas and the problems that accompany it, then we can begin dissecting the problem. <br />
